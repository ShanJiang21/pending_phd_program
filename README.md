## Pending phd_program

> In 1854, Charles published his novel *Hard Times* and it is for me an illustration of Utilitarianism, fancy and realities. 

We are know that 2020 is a tough year and things changed again and again, how can a poor grad student to stick to her/his own dream? How can we support each other in these difficult times? How can we more resilient even confronted with corny bitter truth? I tried to think through the issue and here is what I can offer:

* Inspired by a post on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/iekjt5/updated_list_of_programs_not_accepting_applicants/)
* A sharing list of pending-admission PhD programs in the US
* Mostly social science and some humanities programs
* To be updated if time is available 

We are all in this together. We will all get through it together.
